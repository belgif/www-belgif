# Website www.belgif.be

Source files and code to generate the static pages of the www.belgif.be website

# Content breakdown

## Command line conversion tool

Requires at least JDK11 and maven 3.8 to build the command line application. 

This application processes the RDF Turtle files (in the data subdirectory), and creates a series of static HTML pages in DE, NL, FR and EN.
These RDF files contain the description of various activities, specifications, legal info... linked to the recommendations of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) and some additional static pages (e.g. contact info and terms/conditions)

## Additional download files

Some additional content (powerpoint presentations and/or PDF files) is located in data/downloads. These files are provided by external partners.

## REST guide(s)

A third source of content are the asciidoc files of the [REST API guide](https://github.com/belgif/rest-guide) and REST security guide, formerly hosted by gcloud.belgium.be. 
These files are converted into HTML by a maven build script.

# Docker build script

All the pages and content mentioned above can be generated by running the dockerfile, and copying the contents of the `/tmp/belgif` directory from the resulting image into a local directory. 

```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t belgif:latest . 
docker cp $(docker create --rm belgif:latest):/tmp/belgif belgif-static
```
